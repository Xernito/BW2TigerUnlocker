Black and White 2 Tiger Unlocker
================================

This program lets you unlock Tiger creature in Black and White 2.

The original unlocker program that come with Collector Edition disk
doesn't work correctly with newer version of Windows, or even Wine,
other than Windows 2000 that the unlocker designed for. As it use
a registry value that doesn't exist anymore on new version of Windows
to generate "Unlock.dat" file.

This program is a rewrite of that unlocker program, with improvement
to fix the above issue and able to work even when Black and White 2
is not installed with the installer.

The latest binary can always be found [Here](https://github.com/kytulendu/BW2TigerUnlocker/releases)

To compile the program, use CodeBlocks to open `BW2TigerUnlocker.cbp`
project file.
